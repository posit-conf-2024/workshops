# Description

As most organization's data migrate to the cloud, the ability to analyze data in-place becomes more important.
This workshop will walk you through how to think about remote data, how to access it, and how to analyze it efficiently.
We will review the latest in integrations between R and Databricks.
The two integrations that we will review are:

-   [Spark via Databricks Connect](https://spark.rstudio.com/deployment/databricks-connect.html)

-   [ODBC connection](https://solutions.posit.co/connections/db/databases/databricks/)

During the workshop, we will discuss best practices for when to use which integration, as well as techniques to take your analysis into production.

# Audience
