# Description

This is not a standard workshop, but a six-week online apprenticeship that culminates in-person at posit::conf(2024).

Here, you will learn the foundations of R and the Tidyverse under the guidance of a Posit Academy mentor and in the company of a close group of fellow learners.
You will be expected to complete a weekly curriculum of interactive tutorials, and to attend a weekly presentation meeting with your mentor and fellow learners.
Topics will include the basics of R, importing, visualizing and wrangling data with the tidyverse, and reporting reproducibly with Quarto.

**No prior knowledge of R required.** Visit [posit.co/academy](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/academy/) to learn more about this uniquely effective learning format.
