# Description

Do you need a professional website to showcase your work?
Or have you got an idea for a website at work, but it needs to reflect your organization's brand?
If you've used Quarto to produce a document, you've already got the technical skills to create a Quarto website.
In this workshop, you'll learn everything else you need to build a website and customize its appearance.

You'll get a running start by using a template we've designed to be functional and attractive, but also act as a guide for your learning.
Then you'll:

-   Add pages and navigation, and learn best practices for structuring your content.

-   Customize the visual appearance of your site by mastering the basics of SCSS and CSS and how they apply to Quarto websites.

-   Use listings, a special kind of page, to showcase related content like blog posts, projects, or talks.

By the end of the workshop you'll have built and published (if you want) a personal website, but the same tools and techniques will apply to any kind of website you might like to build.

We'll assume you've used Quarto to produce documents, but we won't assume you have any HTML, CSS/SCSS or Git/GitHub experience, nor will we assume any particular programming language (R, Python etc.) or level of programming experience.

# Audience

This course is for you if you:

-   Have used Quarto to generate documents (e.g. HTML, PDF, MS Word etc.)

-   Are comfortable editing plain text documents (e.g `.qmd`) in your IDE (e.g. RStudio, Visual Studio Code etc.)

-   Want to walk away with your own personal website
