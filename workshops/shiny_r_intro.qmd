  Introduction to builing interactive web apps using Shiny and R
categories: [Shiny, R, reactivity, web apps]
---

# Description

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.
This workshop will start at the beginning: designing and creating user interfaces, learning and mastering the reactive model that connects your R code to the interface, and deploying apps publicly and privately.
We will wrap up with some intermediate-level tools: debugging and modularizing your apps and implementing dynamic user interfaces.
In the end, you’ll be a confident Shiny user, able to design interactive apps to achieve your purpose and produce a polished and professional implementation.

# Audience

This workshop is for you if you:

-   are comfortable with the basics of R, such as writing functions, indexing vectors and lists, debugging simple errors, and working with data structures like data frames,

-   are interested in creating interactive web applications, and

-   have no or minimal experience with Shiny for R.
    If you have a bit of experience, you’ll see things in a new way.
    If you don’t, we’ll get you started on the right footing.
