# Description

Data scientists understand what goes into training a machine learning or statistical model, but bringing that model into a production environment can be daunting.

This workshop will cover the fundamentals of MLOps (machine learning operations), the practices used to create a MLOps strategy, and what kinds of tasks and components are involved. We’ll use vetiver, a framework for MLOps tasks in Python and R, to version, deploy, and monitor the models you have trained and want to deploy and maintain in production reliably and efficiently.

# Audience

We expect participants to have exposure to basic modeling and machine learning practice, but NOT expert familiarity with advanced ML or MLOps topics.

This workshop is for you if you:

-   have intermediate R or Python knowledge (this will be a “choose your own adventure” workshop where you can work through the exercises in either R or Python),

-   can read data from CSV and other flat files, transform and reshape data, and make a wide variety of graphs, and

-   can fit a model to data with your modeling framework of choice.
